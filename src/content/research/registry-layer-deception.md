## Abstract

Autonomous AI agents now explore enterprise systems the way a human intruder
would — enumerating tools, probing capabilities, and reaching for credentials —
but at machine speed and without the deviation that anomaly-based detection is
built to catch. Enumeration is not tradecraft for an agent; it is the default
behavior. When touching everything reachable is the workload, "touched a lot of
things" is not an anomaly to alert on.

Deception closes this gap, and the security field has converged on that
conclusion. A decoy no legitimate process should ever touch produces a clean,
baseline-free signal: the touch is the alert. The open question is no longer
*whether* to deceive agents, but *how to structure* deception so the resulting
signal is high-fidelity and hard to evade.

This paper argues that the unit of deception should be the **registry**, not the
individual token. It presents an architecture in which real, production Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers and decoy MCP servers sit side by side behind a
single gateway portal, indistinguishable to an enumerating agent, with a
two-stage detection boundary that separates an agent *finding* a credential from
an agent *using* it. The architecture is serverless, deployable on edge
infrastructure with zero standing servers, and was demonstrated live — real and
decoy MCP servers behind one portal, an agent enumerating them as equally valid,
and a canary firing on privileged-tool use — at the OWASP 25th Anniversary
Conference in February 2026.

## 1. The problem: intent is invisible at the API layer

Enterprises increasingly wire autonomous agents into their workflows. Through the
Model Context Protocol, an agent can discover a catalog of tools and invoke them
without a human directing each step. That is the feature. It is also the flaw.

In an MCP environment, an agent probing your infrastructure looks identical, at
the API layer, to one running a sanctioned workflow. Two agents can make the same
call to the same tool — one doing legitimate work, one mapping what it can reach.
From the outside there is no difference. Security systems built on request
inspection assume malicious behavior *looks* different. Against an autonomous
agent it does not.

This produces a classification ceiling. An agent can enumerate tools, test
capabilities, and probe for credentials while every control in the stack reports
normal activity. The intent is invisible, and intent is the only thing that
distinguishes reconnaissance from work.

The scale is not hypothetical. MCP adoption grew from roughly 100,000 downloads
in late 2024 to over 8 million by April 2025, surpassing 97 million monthly SDK
downloads by early 2026, with deployments across major enterprises exposing
internal tools, APIs, and credentials to agent-driven access. The protocol was
designed for interoperability, not for exposing or detecting agent intent.

---

## 2. Why anomaly detection fails here

Anomaly-based detection — SIEM correlation, EDR behavioral baselines, thresholds —
assumes attackers move selectively: a target, a path, an effort to stay quiet.
Deviation from a baseline is the signal. That logic holds for human attackers.

Autonomous agents do not move selectively. Enumeration is their baseline. They
touch everything reachable, at machine speed, because that is how they explore
what is available. There is no deviation to alert on when exhaustiveness is the
workload.

This inverts the usual relationship between attacker capability and defender
advantage. A more capable model enumerates *more* thoroughly, not less. If the
detection mechanism depends on the agent touching things, then a better attacker
trips it more often. Independent vendor research has since observed this at the
cloud-account level: in Tracebit's May 2026 study of ten frontier models
attacking an AWS environment, the most capable models tripped more canaries, not
fewer. The defense improves as the attacker improves — a property no
signature- or baseline-based control has. Whether the same holds at the MCP
registry layer is an open question (Section 13).

---

## 3. Why single decoys are necessary but not sufficient

A decoy that no legitimate process should ever touch is the cleanest signal in
security: no baseline, no threshold, no false-positive rate to manage. The
touch is the alert. The field has, correctly, converged on deception as a core
detection layer for agentic threats, and drop-in decoy tokens — a single fake
MCP server, a single decoy tool added to an agent's configuration — are an
excellent first move. They are cheap, fast to deploy, and require no
infrastructure.

But a single decoy has two limitations that matter as agentic attacks become
routine.

**First, a lone decoy can be avoided.** A single fake server that looks unusually
tempting is a single thing for a careful agent to learn to route around. The
decoy's value depends on the agent not being able to tell it apart from the real
environment — and a standalone decoy sits *beside* the real environment rather
than *within* it.

**Second, a single interaction cannot separate curiosity from intent.** A
conversational decoy that asks a caught agent to identify itself receives an
answer — but the answer may be fabricated. Publicly demonstrated conversational
decoys have elicited hallucinated responses (for example, an invented SSH host
key) from probing agents. For catching *that* the agent is lying, this is fine.
But for an alert a SOC will act on, "something answered a question" is a weaker
finding than "something executed a privileged action." One exchange tells you
something touched the decoy. It does not reliably tell you what it intended, and
what it says may be fiction.

The response to both limitations is architectural, not a cleverer single token.

## 4. How MCP server portals work

The architecture in Section 6 is not abstract — it targets a specific, deployed
mechanism: gateway "portals" that centralize multiple MCP servers behind one
authenticated endpoint. Cloudflare's MCP server portals are the reference
implementation used throughout this paper and in the OWASP demonstration
(Section 8). MCP server portals became generally available to all Cloudflare
customers on September 24, 2026, after an open beta. This section summarizes
their public documented behavior as of that release, because both the attack
surface in Section 5 and the architecture in Section 6 follow directly from it.

### 4.1 Request flow

A portal centralizes multiple MCP servers onto one HTTP endpoint
(`https://<subdomain>.<domain>/mcp`). A session proceeds as follows:

1. The MCP client connects to the portal URL and receives a `401` with OAuth
   discovery metadata.
2. The user authenticates through the platform's identity layer (Cloudflare
   Access), or a machine presents service-token headers.
3. The identity is validated, and the portal returns the combined tool catalog
   from every enabled upstream server.
4. On a tool call, the portal resolves the target upstream server from the
   tool's namespace, attaches the appropriate credential, and proxies the
   request. Gateway routing, where enabled, adds HTTP logging and inspection on
   this path.
5. The upstream server responds through the same path.

### 4.2 Naming

Every tool and prompt exposed through a portal is prefixed with its server ID:
`{server_id}_{original_name}`. A tool `list_issues` on a server with ID `github`
appears as `github_list_issues`. Admins can rename tools and rewrite
descriptions at the server or portal level; clients only ever see the rewritten
version. This namespacing is what makes a decoy server's tools visually
consistent with real ones (Section 5, under *Reconnaissance*) — and, in the
wrong hands, what makes control-plane tool-description rewriting possible at
all (Section 5, under *Manipulation and persistence*).

### 4.3 Built-in portal tools

Every portal exposes tools of its own for listing and toggling upstream
servers, and — with context optimization enabled — a regex search tool across
tool names, descriptions, and schemas. These are catalog and search
primitives: an enumerating agent uses them for reconnaissance without ever
touching an upstream server directly.

Portals also support Code Mode, which replaces the upstream tool definitions
with two tools — search and code execution — so that the agent discovers tools
by querying for them and calls them from generated code. Admins set a per-portal
policy: off, opt-in, on by default, or enforced. Under an enforced policy, no
tool definition is sent to the model up front; every tool an agent uses, it
first found by search. This changes what makes a decoy discoverable
(Section 6.2).

### 4.4 Credentials and policy

Each upstream server carries its own access policy, visible only to identities
that match it. A per-server setting decides whether each user authenticates
with their own credential or whether all portal traffic to that server shares
one admin credential; machine sessions using service tokens always use the
admin credential and are excluded from servers that require per-user auth.
This credential-sharing design is the basis of the confused-deputy risk
described in Section 5, under *Privilege*.

### 4.5 Synchronization and logging

Tools and prompts for automatically registered servers re-sync on a fixed
interval using the admin credential; new tools discovered during sync are
enabled automatically. Background sync does not route through the inspection
path used for live traffic. Portal logs record time, status, server,
capability, and duration — not call arguments. Logpush export (Enterprise
plans) adds identity and session context — user, client IP, session ID,
JSON-RPC method, tool name — but its dataset likewise carries no arguments,
request bodies, or response content. Both properties matter for
detection design: sync introduces a delay and a blind spot (Section 5, under
*Evasion*), and thin logging is precisely what a decoy must compensate for
(Section 6.3).

---

## 5. Threat model: attacking the portal

The attacker here is an autonomous agent, or an operator driving one, that has
obtained a foothold: a stolen portal session or service token, a compromised
workstation with a connected MCP client, or a credential with control-plane
access to the portal itself. The same analysis applies to an authorized
researcher testing a portal under permission. The stages below follow the
attacker's natural sequence, each grounded in the portal mechanics of Section 4.

**Reconnaissance.** The full inventory is one call away: the portal's
list-servers tool returns every server's ID and name, and the combined tool
list leaks internal naming conventions through the `{server_id}_` prefix
(Section 4.2). Where regex search over tools is enabled (Section 4.3), an agent
can search directly for the capability it wants — credentials, admin
functions — instead of reading through the full catalog.

**Access.** A stolen portal session or service token carries the full view
available to that identity. Service-token authentication is positioned for
exactly this population — autonomous agents and machine-to-machine
connections — so a leaked token is, in practice, an agent identity.
Separately, a server blocked by policy for a given user may still be reachable
at its direct upstream URL, bypassing the portal (and its logs) entirely,
unless the platform's identity layer is configured as that server's own OAuth
provider.

**Privilege.** Where a server does not require per-user auth (Section 4.4),
every identity connected through the portal inherits the shared admin
credential's access to that server — a confused-deputy pattern documented
broadly in the MCP security literature. Service-token sessions always operate
this way. Controls that assume a human is present — independent MFA, purpose
justification, step-up authentication — do not travel with a request once it
is proxied through the portal under a shared credential.

**Manipulation and persistence.** An identity with control-plane access to the
portal can rewrite a tool's name or description at the portal layer without
touching the upstream server at all; every connected agent then receives the
rewritten version. This is tool poisoning delivered through the registry
rather than the server. Separately, because new tools are enabled
automatically on sync (Section 4.5), a compromised or malicious upstream
server can introduce new capabilities that reach every connected agent within
one sync interval.

**Evasion.** Portal logs record that a tool was called, not what it was called
with (Section 4.5) — a defender sees the shape of an interaction, not its
content. Background sync and direct-to-upstream connections both bypass the
inspected traffic path. And a silently expired admin credential simply removes
a server from the portal with no alert, a failure mode indistinguishable from
a server disabled for unrelated reasons.

**Detection boundary.** Below this boundary — enumeration, capability testing,
parameter probing, schema inspection — activity is indistinguishable from
legitimate exploration and should not, by itself, alert (Section 2). Above
it — retrieval of a privileged artifact followed by an attempt to use it —
intent is unambiguous. The architecture in Section 6 is built to leave that
boundary crossing as the only thing that fires.

---

## 6. The architecture: deception at the registry layer

The core proposal of this paper is to make the **registry** the unit of
deception. Instead of deploying one decoy beside a real environment, blend real
and decoy MCP servers into a single gateway registry so that, to an enumerating
agent, they are indistinguishable.

### 6.1 Server-level side-by-side (the core contribution)

An MCP gateway portal presents a catalog of MCP servers to any connecting agent.
Behind that single portal sit both **real, production MCP servers** — including
third-party servers the organization genuinely uses — and **decoy MCP servers**
built for detection, registered through the same workflow and following the
same server-ID naming convention (Section 4.2) as their real neighbors. The
agent enumerating the portal sees them as one list. There is no "the honeypot"
to avoid, because the honeypots are interleaved with the real servers the agent
actually wants.

This is the property a standalone decoy cannot provide: the enumeration itself
becomes the detection surface. An agent cannot map the environment without
touching the registry, and it cannot tell, from the outside, which servers are
bait.

*Counters: reconnaissance (Section 5).* The attacker's first and cheapest
step — list the servers — returns decoys mixed with real ones.

*(Validated. See Section 8 and the accompanying diagram.)*

### 6.2 Tool-level tiering within a server

Within a decoy server, tools are arranged in tiers of increasing sensitivity, so
that escalation is observable as a *path* rather than a single event:

- **Tier 1 — Safe / informational.** Genuinely useful, answerable tools (e.g.
  listing clusters, reading a namespace quota, requesting access). No detection
  fires here; legitimate automation touches these constantly, and operational
  realism is what keeps the environment believable.
- **Tier 2 — Escalation zone.** Infrastructure tools (e.g. service endpoints, CI
  webhooks) that no ordinary task requires. Intent is beginning to shift.
- **Tier 3 — Privileged artifact.** A single high-value artifact — a credential
  or configuration — with a canary embedded inside it.

Where a portal runs Code Mode or search-based context optimization
(Section 4.3), tools are found by query rather than read from a list. Tier 2
and Tier 3 names and descriptions should therefore contain the terms an
attacker would search for — credentials, secrets, admin, kubeconfig — while
staying plain and non-directive (Section 7, step 4). A decoy that never
matches a search is never found.

### 6.3 The two-stage detection boundary

The privileged artifact fires in two distinct stages:

- **Stage 1 — Access.** The agent *retrieves* the credential. Meaningful, but not
  yet conclusive; an aggressive scanner might grab it.
- **Stage 2 — Use.** The agent *attempts to use* the credential — a real
  execution attempt against the target.

Crossing both stages has one explanation. Critically, Stage 2 is not something
the agent *says*; it is something it *does*. That makes the two-stage chain
resistant to the hallucination problem that undermines single-exchange
conversational decoys. The behavioral chain — access followed by use, delivered
to a SIEM or alerting channel with the full sequence and the edge logs behind it
— is the finding, and it is captured at the decoy itself (full arguments,
headers, source, timing), compensating for what portal logs alone do not
record (Section 4.5).

The two records are complementary. Exported portal logs carry identity and
session context for every call — user, client IP, session ID, tool name — but
no arguments; the decoy carries full arguments but only the identity the portal
forwards. Joining them on session and time turns a canary firing into an
attributed finding: which identity, from where, crossed which stage.

*Counters: privilege and manipulation (Section 5).* A confused-deputy grab of
the credential is Stage 1; a poisoned-description attack that lures an agent
toward using it is caught at Stage 2 regardless of what the description said.

### 6.4 Zero standing infrastructure

The entire portal and its servers run serverless on edge infrastructure
(Cloudflare Workers), with detection provided by open deception primitives
(Canarytokens). There are no servers to provision, patch, or scale, which makes
the decoy environment cheap to run, globally distributed, and easy to keep
believable alongside real production servers.

### 6.5 Breadcrumbs for the bypass path

Section 5 notes that an attacker who learns upstream URLs can skip the portal
entirely. Decoy upstream URLs, placed where an attacker would look for them —
configuration files, internal documentation, repositories — extend the
tripwire to that path. Where gateway-level MCP traffic detection is available,
a direct connection to a decoy host is a second, independent signal alongside
the decoy's own logging.

*Counters: the direct-URL bypass (Section 5, under *Access*).*

### 6.6 Canaries on the control plane (proposed)

Two portal behaviors are themselves plausible tripwires, though neither has
been demonstrated in the validation reported in Section 8 and both are offered
here as future work rather than a proven claim:

- **Definition canaries.** A decoy's tool names and descriptions should never
  legitimately change. If a sync or a control-plane API call changes them,
  someone has touched the upstream server or the portal configuration itself.
- **Toggle canaries.** A decoy server left disabled by default. An agent that
  enables it through the portal's own toggle tool is exploring beyond its
  assigned tools.

*Counters: manipulation and persistence (Section 5).*

### 6.7 What the decoy says back

A decoy's response shapes what happens next, and the right choice depends on
the goal: a refusal that mimics a real control firing, sustained engagement
with fabricated data to prolong observation, content designed to trip the
attacking model's own safety training, or direct interrogation of the agent.
Section 3 already covers why an interrogation-style response is a weaker
finding on its own than the behavioral chain in Section 6.3 — an agent's
self-report may be fabricated, so any response strategy should be treated as
supplementary evidence, not the primary signal.

---

## 7. Deployment guidance

A working version of this architecture is a small build, not a research
project. The steps below assume an existing gateway account and identity
provider already in place.

1. **Inventory the real portal.** List server IDs, naming conventions, auth
   modes, and which servers run without per-user auth (Section 4.4). These
   choices define what a convincing decoy looks like and where the
   confused-deputy risk sits.
2. **Build one decoy server.** A remote MCP server on Cloudflare Workers is
   enough (Section 6.4). Log every request — arguments included — to a
   webhook or SIEM.
3. **Register it through the normal workflow.** Use a server ID that fits the
   organization's naming convention (Section 4.2). Attach an access policy
   that matches the intended visibility: open to everyone for maximum
   coverage, or scoped to identities that should never touch it, so that any
   call is anomalous by construction.
4. **Write the tools in tiers.** Two or three tools per tier (Section 6.2),
   plain descriptions, no instructions aimed at the model — a decoy that
   tries to steer an agent is tool poisoning in its own right, and it would
   confuse benign agents as well as hostile ones.
5. **Route alerts somewhere a human will see them**, with identity context
   attached. Where available, export portal logs via Logpush to the same SIEM
   and correlate on session ID (Section 6.3).
6. **Test with your own agent.** Connect through the portal, confirm the
   decoy appears alongside real servers, walk it through both stages, and
   confirm the alert fires with arguments captured.
7. **Add breadcrumbs** (Section 6.5) for the direct-URL bypass path.
8. **Review monthly.** Re-check that decoys still sync, still match current
   naming, and still alert. Silent admin-token expiry (Section 4.5) applies
   to decoys as much as to real servers; expired servers can be
   re-authenticated directly from the portal.

---

## 8. Validation

The architecture was implemented and demonstrated live at the **OWASP 25th
Anniversary Conference (February 2026)**, in the session *MCP Deception Incubator
— Honeytraps as a Framework for Zero Trust AI Environments*.

The demonstration showed, in sequence:

1. **A single gateway portal** (Cloudflare AI controls / MCP server portal) with
   four MCP servers registered side by side: two real, production servers
   (Cloudflare's own hosted `bindings.mcp.cloudflare.com` and
   `docs.mcp.cloudflare.com`) and two decoy servers built by the author
   (`mcp-threat-trap` and `mcp-deception-incubator-kubernetes`), all in READY
   state.
2. **An agent authorization flow** in which a connecting MCP client was offered
   all four servers together, real and decoy indistinguishable in the same list.
3. **A real agent harness** (Cloudflare Workers AI LLM Playground) pointed at the
   portal, enumerating the combined tool catalog across real and decoy servers.
4. **A live canary alert** firing on privileged-tool use: a Web Bug Canarytoken
   triggered by a `kubeconfig_get` invocation, with a real source IP and a client
   string identifying the decoy server and tool
   (`mcp-deception-incubator-kubernetes/1.0 (tool=kubeconfig_get; ...)`).

This is the validated basis for the "registry-layer" claim: real and decoy MCP
servers behind one portal, an agent treating them as equally valid, and the
two-stage detection firing on privileged use.

## 10. Related work and field context

The proposition that deception is the right control against autonomous agents is
now widely held. The Cloud Security Alliance's May 2026 guidance, *The "AI
Vulnerability Storm": Building a "Mythos-ready" Security Program*, lists "Build
a Deception Capability" as a high-priority control for the next 90 days —
"Deploy canaries and honey tokens"; OpenAI, presenting at Black Hat USA 2026,
included deception among what Thinkst described as the "few recommendations"
it made; and vendor benchmarking of frontier models against canaries in cloud
accounts has reported early warning in most compromising runs (Tracebit, May
2026).

Commercial and open-source single-decoy approaches occupy the token layer and
are valuable first moves:

- **Thinkst's MCP Canarytoken** generates decoy `mcp.json` entries that alert
  on connection or tool call; its **Agent Provocateur** engages and questions
  attacking agents on the network, and has been observed tripping across both
  open and frontier models.
- **Tracebit's context bombs** place content in decoy secrets designed to trip
  an attacking model's own safety guardrails, tested across five frontier
  models in a purpose-built AWS cyber range.
- **Lenny Zeltser's decoy MCP server guide** documents building a workstation
  tripwire on Cloudflare Workers.
- **HoneyMCP** injects ghost tools into an MCP server to detect and engage
  attackers at the single-server level.
- **Decoy Tripwire** is a local proxy that adds decoy tools alongside a
  client's real servers and pauses the agent when one fires.
- **Praetorian's Knossos** generates realistic decoy AWS environments from an
  organization's real naming and IAM patterns — a registry-adjacent idea, but
  for cloud accounts rather than MCP registries.

Each of these places a decoy on an endpoint, inside a single server, in a
cloud account, or in front of one client. This paper is complementary: it
addresses the layer above the single token, arguing that as agentic attacks
become routine, deception must be *structured as an environment* — tiered
tools, staged artifacts, and real and decoy servers interleaved at the MCP
registry itself — rather than planted as an isolated tripwire. The tripwire
tells you someone is there. The architecture tells you what they came to do.

## 11. Limitations and future work

- **Detection, not prevention.** The architecture surfaces intent; containment
  and response are downstream and out of scope here.
- **Depends on enumeration.** Effective against agents that explore by default;
  a targeted adversary with prior environment knowledge may not enumerate.
- **Benign agents can trip decoys.** A legitimate agent selects tools
  autonomously; a decoy description that overlaps with a real task will
  produce false positives. Descriptions must target capabilities outside
  every legitimate user's scope, and the visibility policy in Section 6.1
  should narrow exposure where that risk is highest.
- **Decoys can be fingerprinted.** Differences in hosting, latency, tool
  count, empty resource lists, or response style can separate decoys from
  real servers to a careful attacker. Decoys should be hosted and shaped like
  their neighbors.
- **Realism is an operational cost.** Decoy servers and tools must remain
  believable relative to the real servers they sit beside, and this cost
  recurs — see the monthly review step in Section 7.
- **Portal capacity is finite.** Cloudflare's portals support a bounded number
  of servers per portal; decoys consume that budget alongside real ones.
- **Sync and expiry apply to decoys too.** The same fixed-interval sync and
  silent admin-credential expiry described in Section 4.5 affect decoy
  servers exactly as they affect real ones, and an expired decoy fails
  silently rather than loudly.
- **Guardrail-dependent responses may not hold.** A response strategy that
  relies on the attacking model's own safety training (Section 6.7) assumes
  those guardrails are present; a real attacker may not be using a model that
  has them. Treat anything an agent reports about itself as unverified — see
  the hallucinated-SSH-key example in Section 3.
- **Scope.** This paper covers remote HTTP MCP servers behind a gateway
  portal. Local stdio servers are out of scope, though the principles should
  transfer.
- **Future directions.** Agent-to-agent (A2A) deception surfaces; adaptive
  decoys that evolve with the environment; measurement of evasion cost when
  decoys are interleaved with real servers versus deployed standalone;
  standardized telemetry for the two-stage chain into common SOC pipelines.

## 12. Conclusion

The debate over whether deception works against autonomous AI agents is settled;
it works. The next question is structural. A single decoy catches curiosity but
can be avoided and cannot cleanly separate reconnaissance from intent. Making the
registry the unit of deception — real and decoy MCP servers side by side behind
one gateway, with a two-stage boundary that distinguishes finding a credential
from using it — turns an agent's own default behavior, exhaustive enumeration,
into a high-fidelity signal. Early cloud-account evidence suggests that signal
may grow stronger as models get more capable (Sections 2 and 13). This
architecture was built on zero standing infrastructure and demonstrated live in
February 2026. It is offered here, openly, as a reference for teams building
detection for AI-native environments.

---

## 13. Next

Existing empirical work on agents and deception measures canaries placed in
cloud accounts (Section 2). It does not measure the setting this paper
describes: real and decoy MCP servers presented side by side in one registry,
where the agent chooses among them rather than stumbling on a planted secret.
Three questions follow directly from the architecture:

1. Do agents distinguish decoy servers from real ones in a shared catalog, and
   does that ability grow with model capability?
2. How often does an agent that crosses Stage 1 (access) go on to Stage 2
   (use), and does that ratio vary by model?
3. Does the capability inversion observed at the cloud-account level — more
   capable models tripping more decoys — hold at the registry layer?

At OWASP LASCON 2026 (Austin, October 29–30), the author will present benchmark
results measuring how different frontier models behave when they discover real
and decoy servers side by side on an MCP portal — the empirical follow-up to
the architecture presented here.
